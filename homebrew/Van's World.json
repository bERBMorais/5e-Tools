This essentially dominates them (a contested check vs. Arcana or Intimidation to act contrary to your whim) and if they are killed, their skeletons tear out of their flesh, animate and loyal to you.

Saving throws to resist enchantments automatically fail on the basis the target simply has neither the will nor desire to fight the one who plays it – they have been robbed of their will by the void. The catch is that the void is a terribly hungry patron. Playing the Lyre of Longing causes all physical stats to ebb. Each use costs a single point of Strength, Dexterity and Constitution that only return at a rate of one per week for one category. Most people who draw on it’s terrible power have drained themselves to ash or simply succumb to common illness after years of careful abuse, weak as kittens and surrounded by mindless followers."

You cast at the spell’s base level and bonuses that improve your healing capabilities (such as feats, domains, or class benefits) do not apply as these powers come from a dark place. These spells cannot be cast stealthily; conversely, casting them attracts attention. Your teammates prefer your healing touch even if a more skilled cleric is present.
