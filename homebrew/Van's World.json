The catch is that the void is a terribly hungry patron. Playing the Lyre of Longing causes all physical stats to ebb. Each use costs a single point of Strength, Dexterity and Constitution that only return at a rate of one per week for one category.

Until dawn, anything the PC dreams may enter the material plane and gain a physical form.

The goblet refills to the brim once an hour and never spills. The catch is each time you use this item, a proportional amount of health is lost from you or an ally you share it with on waking from your next rest. Don’t drink yourself to death!

A) Cure Wounds: (lvl 1-5: 1/day, lvl6-10: 2/day, lvl11-15: 3/day, lvl16+: 4/day), and B) Lesser Restoration: Once per day, and C) Greater Restoration: Once every three days. You cast at the spell’s base level and bonuses that improve your healing capabilities (such as feats, domains, or class benefits) do not apply as these powers come from a dark place. These spells cannot be cast stealthily; conversely, casting them attracts attention. Your teammates prefer your healing touch even if a more skilled cleric is present.
